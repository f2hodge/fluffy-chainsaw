HTML, CSS, JavaScript crashes

<!-- HTML Cheat Sheet -->

What is HTML? :

- Hypertext Markup Language
- Not a programming language
- Markup Language for creating webpages / documents
- Building blocks of the web

Creating an HTML File:

- Does NOT need a server
- Files must end with the .html extension
- Runs in a web browser
- index.html is the root / home page of a website
- Tags open and close, closing with a forward slash, but some are self-closing and only single

Page Structure:

- Open and closing html tags, inside a head(which doesn't render in the page) and body
- The body is the page content for the website
- Doctype at the top indicates the type of document(simpler in HTML5 from other versions)

Inline vs. Block Level Elements:

- Inline Elements:
  - Do not start on a new line
  - Take only the necessary width for content
- Block Elements:
  - Start on a new line
  - Take the full width available
- Block Level: div, h1 - h6, p, form
- Inline Level: span, img, a

Tag Attributes:

<!--
Sample:
<tagname attrubuteName="attrubuteValue">content</tagname>
Example:
<h1 title="My Company">About Us</h1>
 -->

- All tags can have attributes
- Provide Information about an element
- Placed within the start tag
- Key/value pairs (id="someId")
